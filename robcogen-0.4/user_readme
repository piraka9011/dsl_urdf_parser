Installation
============
In fact nothing has to be "installed".
Just unpack the archive file somewhere in your filesystem.

The contents should be:

- robcogen.jar    : the actual robotics code generator
- lib/            : other jar files required by the generator
- maxima_libs/    : the Maxima source code required by the code generator to work
- framework.properties
  cpp.properties
  log4j.properties : template configuration files. Change them according to your
                     needs; all the defaults should be fine.

- iit_rbd_cpp.zip : the archive with the C++ headers required to compile the
   generated C++ code. Unpack this file somewhere, and install (ie copy) the
   headers into a system folder by running the install script.
   Note that these files are not required to *run* the code generator itself,
   but rather to use its C++ output.

To generate coordinate transforms and Jacobians you will need to install the
Maxima symbolic engine.

Usage
=====
Invoke the generator with:

./robcogen.sh <model>.kindsl [<config>.dtdsl]

where
- <model>.kindsl is the document describing the kinematics/dynamics of your robot
- <config>.dtdsl is the document containing the desired transforms/Jacobians (optional argument)

Remember that before generating any implementation of transforms/Jacobians, you
first need to generate the symbolic code for them (ie the Maxima code).
In the generator menu, just select the generation target for the Maxima code
first, if you have not done it before.
